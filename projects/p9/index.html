    <h1>Mainframe Modernization & Java Migration Support for a Regulated Banking Platform</h1>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4-month modernization and rule extraction engagement</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Consultant – COBOL Analysis, Client Interaction, Rule Reconciliation, Java Mapping</p>
    <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Refactoring of legacy COBOL logic into Java for BusinessPartner attribute delivery into EGP containers</p>
    <p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Legacy rule mining, DIH field mapping, EGP integration, testing, and documentation</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        A regulated banking platform initiated a modernization of its data provisioning process for core banking attributes by replacing
        legacy DB2 UNLOAD-based pipelines with DIH-sourced, Java-transformed EGP containers. The modernization vision aimed to generate
        Java purely from business definitions; however, the legacy COBOL programs contained critical, undocumented transformation logic,
        SQL operations, and edge case handling that materially influenced downstream data consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
        I supported the project by bridging these two realities: extracting the actual transformation behavior from COBOL, aligning it with
        the client’s documented understanding, and enabling traceable and testable Java mapping. This ensured consistency across data,
        logic, and integration points — reducing migration risk and avoiding silent behavioral drift.
    </p>

    <h3>The Goal:</h3>
    <p>
        Deliver clean, testable Java implementations of BusinessPartner attribute logic aligned with both client expectations and proven
        legacy behavior, while supporting modern frameworks (DIH, EGP, Spring Boot).
    </p>

            <li>Enabled faster decisions by translating legacy behavior into implementable Java requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Helped define test cases and boundary scenarios based on reconciled rules</li>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <div class="tech-section">
        <ul>
            <li>Modernization fails quietly when legacy edge cases are not surfaced early — rule mining must precede implementation.</li>
            <li>Business documentation is necessary but not sufficient; production COBOL behavior often contains “hidden requirements”.</li>
            <li>Traceability (COBOL → rule → Java → test) is the fastest path to confidence in regulated migrations.</li>
            <li>Data sourcing migrations (UNLOAD → DIH) require semantic validation, not just field name mapping.</li>
            <li>Workshops accelerate delivery when the mainframe SME translates legacy behavior into implementable requirements.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Modernization Rule Mining Checklist</h2>
    <div class="tech-section">
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Start with COBOL behavior mining before relying solely on business definitions</li>
            <li>✅ Identify SQL operations and hidden transformations affecting downstream outputs</li>
            <li>✅ Build traceability: source logic → reconciled rule → implementation → test case</li>
            <li>✅ Validate DIH field availability and semantic equivalence (not just naming)</li>
            <li>✅ Use reconciliation workshops to close gaps and obtain sign-off</li>
            <li>✅ Design tests around edge cases, not only “happy path” scenarios</li>
            <li>✅ Document assumptions and unresolved gaps explicitly for governance</li>
            <li>✅ Ensure the final Java output matches EGP container contracts</li>
        </ul>
